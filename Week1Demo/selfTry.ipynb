      "Python was conceived in the late 1980s[35] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),[36] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[8] Its implementation began in December 1989.[37] Van Rossum continued as Python's lead developer until July 12, 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[38] In January, 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member \"Steering Council\" to lead the project.[39]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[41] Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[42] and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[44][45]\n",
      "\n",
      "Features and philosophy\n",
      "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[46] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[47] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[48][49] and logic programming.[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets and generator expressions.[51] The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[52]\n",
      "\n",
      "The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[53]\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
      "Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
      "Simple is better than complex.\n",
      "Complex is better than complicated.\n",
      "Readability counts.\n",
      "Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[53] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[54]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[55] When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[56]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[57][58]\n",
      "\n",
      "A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonists, Pythonistas, and Pythoneers.[59][60]\n",
      "\n",
      "Syntax and semantics\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics\n",
      "Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[61]\n",
      "\n",
      "Indentation\n",
      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics § Indentation\n",
      "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[62] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.[1] This feature is also sometimes termed the off-side rule. The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean. This results into Python programs that look similar and consistent.[63]\n",
      "\n",
      "Statements and control flow\n",
      "Python's statements include (among others):\n",
      "\n",
      "The assignment statement (token '=', the equals sign). This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language. Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to \"typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2\". The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address. The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type. In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to \"(generic) name x receives a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2.\" This is termed binding the name to the object. Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable. Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc. Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2; y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound. Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it. However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.\n",
      "The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).\n",
      "The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.\n",
      "The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.\n",
      "The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.\n",
      "The raise statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.\n",
      "The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.\n",
      "The def statement, which defines a function or method.\n",
      "The with statement, from Python 2.5 released on September 2006,[64] which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.[65]\n",
      "The pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.\n",
      "The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.\n",
      "The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.\n",
      "The import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program. There are three ways of using import: import <module name> [as <alias>] or from <module name> import * or from <module name> import <definition 1> [as <alias 1>], <definition 2> [as <alias 2>], ....\n",
      "The print statement was changed to the print() function in Python 3.[66]\n",
      "Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will.[67][68] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators.[69] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[70]\n",
      "\n",
      "Expressions\n",
      "Some Python expressions are similar to languages such as C and Java, while some are not:\n",
      "\n",
      "Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) // and floating point/division.[71] Python also added the ** operator for exponentiation.\n",
      "From Python 3.5, the new @ infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[72][73]\n",
      "From Python 3.8, the syntax :=, called as 'walrus operator' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[74]\n",
      "In Python, == compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value[75] and objects by reference.[76] (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the equals() method.) Python's is operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example a <= b <= c.\n",
      "Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic &&, ||, ! used in Java and C.\n",
      "Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression termed a generator expression.[51]\n",
      "Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.\n",
      "Conditional expressions in Python are written as x if c else y[77] (different in order of operands from the c ? x : y operator common to many other languages).\n",
      "Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as [1, 2, 3], are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as (1, 2, 3), are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The + operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable t initially equal to (1, 2, 3), executing t = t + (4, 5) first evaluates t + (4, 5), which yields (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which is then assigned back to t, thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" of t, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[78]\n",
      "Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through, and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.[79]\n",
      "Python has a \"string format\" operator %. This functions analogous to printf format strings in C, e.g. \"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2) evaluates to \"spam=blah eggs=2\". In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the format() method of the str class, e.g. \"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2). Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\": blah = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'.[80]\n",
      "Python has various kinds of string literals:\n",
      "Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash (\\) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[80]\n",
      "Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby.\n",
      "Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an r. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare \"@-quoting\" in C#.\n",
      "Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as a[key], a[start:stop] or a[start:stop:step]. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example a[:] returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\n",
      "In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "List comprehensions vs. for-loops\n",
      "Conditional expressions vs. if blocks\n",
      "The eval() vs. exec() built-in functions (in Python 2, exec is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.\n",
      "Statements cannot be a part of an expression, so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as a = 1 cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement. This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator = for an equality operator == in conditions: if (c = 1) { ... } is syntactically valid (but probably unintended) C code but if c = 1: ... causes a syntax error in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or this) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).[81]\n",

      "Typing\n",
      "\n",
      "The standard type hierarchy in Python 3\n",
      "Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, SpamClass() or EggsClass()), and the classes are instances of the metaclass type (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[82] The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long term plan is to support gradual typing[83] and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython.

Additionally, it has a unary operator (~), which essentially inverts all the bits of its one argument. For integers, this means ~x=-x-1.[88] Other operators include bitwise shift operators x << y, which shifts x to the left y places, the same as x*(2**y) , and x >> y, which shifts x to the right y places, the same as x//(2**y).[89]\n",

So 7//3 == 2, -7//3 == -3, 7.5//3 == 2.0 and -7.5//3 == -3.0. Adding from __future__ import division causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).\n",

It also means that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a is valid for both positive and negative values of a. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of a%b is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, b), where b is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (b, 0] when b is negative.[91]\n",

Integers are transparently switched from the machine-supported maximum fixed-precision (usually 32 or 64 bits), belonging to the python type int, to arbitrary precision, belonging to the Python type long, where needed.

      "Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.[125]\n",
      "Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready.

      "Python was conceived in the late 1980s[35] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),[36] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[8]\n",
      "Sentence number 20 : Its implementation began in December 1989.[37]\n",
      "Sentence number 21 : Van Rossum continued as Python's lead developer until July 12, 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[38]\n",

      "Sentence number 24 : It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.[41]\n",
      "Sentence number 25 : Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x[42] and 2.7.x version series.\n",
      "Sentence number 26 : Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[44][45]\n",

      "Features and philosophy\n",
      "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language.\n",
      "Sentence number 27 : Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming[46] and metaobjects (magic methods)).[47]\n",
      "Sentence number 28 : Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[48][49] and logic programming.[50]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence number 29 : Python uses dynamic typing, and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.\n",
      "Sentence number 30 : It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence number 31 : Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition.\n",
      "Sentence number 32 : It has filter, map, and reduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets and generator expressions.[51]\n",
      "Sentence number 33 : The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[52]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence number 34 : The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:[53]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence number 35 : Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Sentence number 39 : Readability counts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence number 40 : Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible.\n",
      "Sentence number 41 : This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.\n",
      "Sentence number 42 : Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology.\n",
      "Sentence number 43 : In contrast to Perl's \"there is more than one way to do it\" motto, Python embraces a \"there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it\" design philosophy.[53] Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[54]\n",
      "\n",
      "Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.[55]\n",
      "Sentence number 44 : When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler.\n",
      "Sentence number 45 : Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence number 46 : An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use.\n",
      "Sentence number 47 : This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[56]—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.[57][58]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentence number 48 : A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style.\n",
      "Sentence number 49 : To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.\n",
      "Sentence number 50 : In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.\n",
      "\n",

      "Main article: Python syntax and semantics\n",
      "Python is meant to be an easily readable language.\n",
      "Sentence number 52 : Its formatting is visually uncluttered, and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation.\n",
      "Sentence number 53 : Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are optional.\n",
      "Sentence number 54 : It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[61]\n",

      "Sentence number 55 : Python syntax and semantics § Indentation\n",
      "Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks.\n",
      "Sentence number 56 : An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[62]\n",
      "Sentence number 57 : Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure.[1]\n",
      "Sentence number 58 : This feature is also sometimes termed the off-side rule.\n",
      "Sentence number 59 : The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean.\n",
      "Sentence number 60 : This results into Python programs that look similar and consistent.[63]\n",

      "Sentence number 62 : This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages, and this fundamental mechanism (including the nature of Python's version of variables) illuminates many other features of the language.\n",
      "Sentence number 63 : Assignment in C, e.g., x = 2, translates to \"typed variable name\n",
      "Sentence number 64 : x receives a copy of numeric value 2\".\n",
      "Sentence number 65 : The (right-hand) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the (left-hand) variable name is the symbolic address.\n",
      "Sentence number 66 : The memory allocated to the variable is large enough (potentially quite large) for the declared type.\n",
      "Sentence number 67 : In the simplest case of Python assignment, using the same example, x = 2, translates to \"(generic) name x receives a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object of numeric (int) type of value 2.\n",
      "Sentence number 68 : \" This is termed binding the name to the object.\n",
      "Sentence number 69 : Since the name's storage location doesn't contain the indicated value, it is improper to call it a variable.\n",
      "Sentence number 70 : Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types, including strings, procedures, complex objects with data and methods, etc.\n",
      "Sentence number 71 : Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names, e.g., x = 2;\n",
      "Sentence number 72 : y = 2; z = 2 result in allocating storage to (at most) three names and one numeric object, to which all three names are bound.\n",
      "Sentence number 73 : Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it.\n",
      "Sentence number 74 : However at a given time a name will be bound to some object, which will have a type; thus there is dynamic typing.\n",
      "\n",

      "Sentence number 95 : However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators.[69] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator.\n",
      "Sentence number 96 : From Python 2.5, it is possible to pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.[70]\n",
